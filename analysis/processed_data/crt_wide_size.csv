Here’s a quick way to solve this question.
We know that $52 is the total price of the leggings and the scarf.
Let’s say the leggings cost $x.

Explanation: This is a simple question. We need to solve for the time taken for half the lake to freeze.
The lake's surface doubles in size every day. So after 10 days, the lake's surface will be 2^10 or 1024 times the original size.

The depth of the snow cover doubles every hour.
So, it takes 10 hours for the snow depth to reach 2 meters.
Now, to reach 1 meter depth, the time required will be half of the time required to reach 2 meters depth.
So, the time required to reach 1 meter depth is 10/2 = 5 hours.
